 	                   	<p>I attended RISD on a full scholarship at seventeen-years-old. I did not have a plan, I was an artist by default. Well, I was an introverted orphan who liked to draw animals. On the first day at RISD I learned the word illustrator and decided I wanted to become an animal illustrator. I only wanted to draw lions and tigers and bears.. and horses...and birds... like this:

 		               		</div>
 		                <p>Things went a little differently than I planned. The school wanted me to draw people...nude people. Okay sometimes they had cloth draped around them, but I had never seen anyone naked, like... five feet in front of me before. But then I had never drawn on a huge pad with a piece of charcoal before either. In the end what I could do with the pad, the charcoal and a weird piece of rubber they insisted was an eraser were more fascinating than the nude man baring his junk for all the students to freely eyeball.

 				<p>In my four years at RISD I learned how do alot of artsy things. I made puppets through a class in toymaking, learned to sculpt stone and wood in sculpture classes, made  a vacumn cleaner that looked like an alligator and learned lots of traditional art mediums like gouche, pen and ink and watercolor, oil and acrylic painting.

 				<p>I also learned about the RISD nightlife of dancing until the wee hours of dawn, smoking pot and pulling all nighters to complete in one night projects that I'd been given two weeks to finish.

 				<p> And just so you don't think I was goofing off all the time, I was also taking classes at Brown in theatre. Did I forget to mention that I was an actor? I got into acting when I attended an audition to support a classmate. It wasn't enough that I sit and watch the audition, my mate isisted I audition too. Sadly I got the part and he did not, but it was a paying gig, so orphan me had to accept the role...I needed the money cause I planned to attend <strong>RISD</strong>... to get better at drawing animals...which I loved.

 				<p> At any rate that summer job lead to another acting job at Brown's esteemed Rites and Reasons theatre where I worked both on stage and behind the scenes as a gopher for the set/prop design people.  All this acting stuff happened in the two summers before I started RISD, but by the time I was a sophmore at RISD I had hooked up with some of my former fellow actors and once again I was acting at Brown... and taking classes...and considering acting as a career choice. 
 				</p>
 				<p>But then I got a serious offer from a company in New York the <strong>"Devil's Playground"</strong> and that scared me. In this manner I figured out I was too much of a pussy to be an actor...I'm not a fan of attention. Plus I thought I'd go the way of Sid and Nancy...drugs and booze. So by junior year at RISD I let go of the acting bug and focused on my school projects.
